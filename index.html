		    <h3 class="mb-0"> Welcome to my E-Portfolio </h3>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
My name is Daniela Arias, I have a degree in international hotel business administration, with a postgraduate degree in Global Business Management and an advanced Le Cordon Blue certification.

In 2015 I began my internship in the hotel world, in which I served as sales manager, secretary of the food and beverage department, maid, cook and pastry chef. I tried to acquire as much knowledge as I could since each department was completely different but at the end of the day everyone was looking for the same thing, which is customer satisfaction.

Apart from my work experience, when I was 14 years old, I made the best decision of my life, which was to start a makeup business. Specifically, I was in charge of wholesale and retail makeup resale throughout Panama, thus distributing the merchandise day by day. This was a business that I kept for more than 20 years and thank God it opened the door to many new opportunities for me.

After finishing my degree and leading different personal life projects, I graduated with a high score, thus being Cum Ladem. The university for me was a great boost that gave me the illusion of bettering myself and continuing my studies in another country. It was a little later that I made the decision to further my studies and study in Canada.

I currently speak Spanish and English fluently and I am starting my studies to learn French. I love to travel, meet new people and embark on new challenges.</p>
